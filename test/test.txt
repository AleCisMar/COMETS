This folder contains test data to run COMETS

It includes four publicly available metagenomes from Hypersaline environments:
2010Bt1.fastq.gz
2010Bt3.fastq.gz

and Marine environments:
Kingman_atoll.fastq.gz
Sargasso_sea.fastq.gz

Since all files are single-end raw reads, the simplest test command to analyze viral reads should look like:

comets -f se -g Viruses
